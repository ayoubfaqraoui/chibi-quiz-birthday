## üåê Phase 2: Custom Domain Setup with Hostinger

### Step 4: Purchase Domain from Hostinger

#### 4.1 Choose Your Domain
1. Go to [hostinger.com](https://hostinger.com)
2. Use the domain search tool to find available domains
3. Suggested domain ideas:
   - `fadwa-birthday-quiz.com`

   - `fadwa-quiz.com`

#### 4.2 Purchase Process
1. Add your chosen domain to cart
2. Select domain registration period (1 year minimum)
3. **Important**: You only need the domain registration, not hosting
4. Complete the purchase process
5. Create your Hostinger account

#### 4.3 Access Domain Management
1. Log into your Hostinger account
2. Go to **"Domains"** section
3. Click **"Manage"** next to your new domain

### Step 5: Configure DNS Settings

#### 5.1 Get Vercel's DNS Information
1. Go back to your Vercel dashboard
2. Click on your deployed project
3. Go to **"Settings"** tab
4. Click **"Domains"** in the sidebar
5. Click **"Add Domain"**
6. Enter your purchased domain (e.g., `fadwa-birthday-quiz.com`)
7. Vercel will show you DNS records to configure

#### 5.2 Update Hostinger DNS
1. In Hostinger, go to your domain management
2. Find **"DNS Zone"** or **"DNS Management"**
3. You'll need to add these records (Vercel will provide exact values):

**A Record:**
- **Type**: A
- **Name**: @ (or leave blank)
- **Value**: Vercel's IP address (they'll provide this)
- **TTL**: 3600

**CNAME Record:**
- **Type**: CNAME

- **TTL**: 3600

4. Save the DNS changes

### Step 6: Verify Domain Connection

#### 6.1 Wait for Propagation
- DNS changes can take 24-48 hours to fully propagate
- Usually works within 1-2 hours

#### 6.2 Check Domain Status
1. In Vercel, go to **Settings > Domains**
2. Your domain should show as **"Valid Configuration"**
3. SSL certificate will be automatically generated

#### 6.3 Test Your Custom Domain
1. Visit your custom domain in a browser
2. Verify HTTPS is working (you should see a lock icon)
3. Test both `yourdomain.com` and `www.yourdomain.com`

## üîß Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Build Failures
**Problem**: Build fails during deployment
**Solutions**:
- Check that all dependencies are in `package.json`
- Ensure no TypeScript errors in your code
- Verify all image paths are correct

### Images Not Loading
**Problem**: Chibi stickers or other images don't appear
**Solutions**:
- Ensure all images are in the `public/` folder
- Check image file names match exactly (case-sensitive)
- Verify image paths start with `/` (e.g., `/img/chibi-stickers/happy.png`)

### Domain Not Working
**Problem**: Custom domain shows error or doesn't load
**Solutions**:
- Wait longer (DNS can take up to 48 hours)
- Double-check DNS records in Hostinger
- Ensure domain is pointing to correct Vercel project
- Contact Hostinger support if DNS issues persist

### SSL Certificate Issues
**Problem**: "Not Secure" warning in browser
**Solutions**:
- Wait for Vercel to generate SSL certificate (automatic)
- Check domain configuration in Vercel
- Try accessing with `https://` prefix
